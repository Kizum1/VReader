# VReader for Metaverse Hackathon 2023. https://itch.io/jam/mc-vr-hackathon

Project Developers:

Konstantin Victoria: Project Gutenburg API

Robin Simpson: Bookshelf functionality with the API

Jay Chong: Level design and linkage

This is a project created using Roblox Studios. By using free ROBLOX assets for world building, and the Project Gutenberg API we created a book reader in VR. You can read your book in VR, all the while enjoying the  scenery of three different worlds. To get started, join the lobby world and then head to your desired world based on the theme. Then stand in the glowing circle and wait to be teleported. Once you are there pick a book, pick a location, and start reading!

Since we used Roblox Studios to develop our VR app, we were unable to use Git/GitHub to constantly commit our code. However ROBLOX Studios does have a script history that we have provided to prove that this project was created during the Metaverse Hackathon time frame. 

All assets used were free and public resources. API was grabbed from https://www.gutenberg.org/ and most terrain assets were availible via the Roblox marketplace. Music is also provided for free by https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/soundeffects
