# VReader
This is a project created using Roblox Studios. By using free ROBLOX assets for world building, and the Project Gutenberg API we created a book reader in VR. You can read your book in VR, all the while enjoying the  scenery of three different worlds. To get started, join the lobby world and then head to your desired world based on the theme. Then stand in the glowing circle and wait to be teleported. Once you are there pick a book, pick a location, and start reading!
