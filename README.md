NOTES TO JUDGES (IMPORTANT)

Since we used Roblox Studios to develop our VR app, we were unable to use Git or GitHub to constantly commit our code. However, ROBLOX Studios does have a script history that we have provided to prove that this project was created during the Metaverse Hackathon time frame.

All assets used were free and public resources. API was grabbed from https://www.gutenberg.org/, and most terrain assets were available via the Roblox marketplace. Music is also provided for free at https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/soundeffects.
